Zumo examples
-------------

This folder contains a number of small projects that can be used to learn how Zumo works. Each folder holds a single
project and is self-contained. Note, though, that the projects reference the zumo.js located on the parent output
folder.

The code in each example includes plenty of inline comments that explain the more relevant aspects of the code and
configuration methods.
